<h1> What is a Piping Plover? </h1> 
<p>  The Piping Plover is a small endangered migratory shorebird that nests exclusively on sandy beaches in North America. There are three distinct
 populations that do not overlap, one in the prairies, one in the atlantic provinces and one around the Greak Lakes. For the most part, these populations do not interact,
 which means that the destruction of one population means exterpation in that area. Worldwide, there are estimated to be between 6000-7000 Piping Plover individuals, but in 
 2021, there was around 74 nesting pairs in the Great Lakes Region. Piping Plovers are closely related to Killdeer, but nest and forage exclsuively on sandy beaches. The popularity 
 and overdevelopment of sandy beaches has lead to a sharp decline in Plover populations, with the Great Lakes population previously decimated to only 12-13 pairs on isolated 
 beaches in 1977. Since then, conservation programs have worked to protect nest sites to help boost the population and provide public education about Piping Plovers.  </p> <!-- this is not edited or spell checked -->

<h1> Piping Plover Lifecycle</h1>
<p> In late April- Early May Piping Plover's return from their annual migration to nest on northern beaches. 
Piping Plovers jump from beach to beach looking for a partner (not easy when you are an endangered species!), and when they find a 
suitable partner will display courtship behaviours and begin to nest. Male Plovers will dig countless scraps (small depressions in the sand) and
 invite the female to check them out. When the female is satisfied with the location and quality, she will lay up to 4 pebble coloured eggs. 
 Both parents take turns incubating the eggs, and they continue to incubate for around 27 days. Piping Plover chicks are precocial, which means 
 they hatch with plenty of fuzz and are ready to run around and forage for themselves within a few hours of hatching. While the chicks can run 
 around, they cannot fly and are protected by both parents. Parents will defend them from gulls, lead them to good foraging spots and brood (cuddle) 
 them to keep them warm. Chicks take around 23 days to be able to fly, but will stick around on beaches for longer to pack on fat reserves for their 
 trip south. Most Piping Plovers leave their nesting grounds by August, with the females usually heading back first followed by males and then chicks.
 Then in spring, the whole cycle repeats! </p> <!-- This content did not exist anywhere else prior to this website but I repeated plover facts often enough I just wrote it all out fairly quickly -->

<h1> Piping Plover Technican </h1>
<p> In my capacity as a Piping Plover Technican for Birds Canada I completed a variety of tasks including: </p> 
<ul>
	<li>Monitored sandy beaches in Southern Ontario for the arrival of Piping Plovers in spring</li>
	<li>Surveyed beaches for Piping Plover nesting suitability </li>
	<li>Set up fencing, nest enclsoures and informational signs around confirmed Piping Plover nests</li>
	<li>Monitored Piping Plover nests, collecting data on Plover behaviour while also providing eductation to the public </li>
	<li>Created social media posts for public education like this <a href="https://twitter.com/ontarioplovers/status/1416080244675686411?s=20">one</a></li> <!-- More Links as well  -->
	<li> Analyzed Plover Nesting success to determine the efficacy of predator exclosures </li>
	<li> Assissted with banding of Plover chicks </li>
	<li> Helped beachgoers identify and avoid walking into the Piping Plovers </li>
	<li> Wrote a report about the unique sand dune ecosystem of Sauble Beach</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.birdscanada.org/ontario-piping-plover-nesting-season-saw-power-couples-and-predators/">Wrote an article about the 2021 Plover Season that appeared in the Bird's Canada newletter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>*Usually, the locations of endangered species are not made public for the saftey of the species. In the case of the Piping Plover, the locations are widely publicised as
 they are already busy locations and public awarness of the Piping Plover is important to their conservation. A large part of my job consisted of following the plover family around
 and ensuring that people did not walk right into them, and seperate the parents from the chicks. </h2> <!-- Very important to mention! I think there is a law associated with this.  -->
